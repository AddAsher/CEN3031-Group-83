## What issues your team planned to address
* We planned to link our front end and back end work, allowing storage of username/password for the login screen.
* We planned to add in login authentification in this linked format to ensure it will work for the actual website.
* We planned to get further understanding of the other side of our group in order to ensure we both knew how linking would function.
* We planned to further discuss functionality plans and how front and back end would work for the stages of the project past the login page.

## Which ones were successfully completed
* The main goal of linking our front end and back end work was accomplished.
* All group members developed a greater understanding of the other ends of the projects so it became easier to discuss future ideas.
## Which ones didn't and why?
* We didnt discuss further functionality as much as we wanted to due to scheduling issues.
* We didnt test the login authentification linked with the front and back end as thoroughly as we wanted due to time constraints.
