As a high school student interested in coming to UF, I want to be able to see all the club opportunities available so I could make the best choice of what school I want to attend.

As a club president, I want a platform that could reach new potential members to bolster our number of members

As a active member of multiple clubs, I want an app  that allows me to see and keep track of all events the clubs I am part of host, because it is difficult to keep with all of them on my own
