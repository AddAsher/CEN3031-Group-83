Concept: There are a pleothera of clubs across UF, students could struggle to keep up with the variety of events that each club be hosting at any given time. Our proposal is an website that allows the leaders of the clubs of UF to post detailed descriptions of their events, locations, and times, along with a display of the real time location of the event on the UF Map.
